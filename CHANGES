Since 0.5.0 (2006-05-30)
========================
Features
--------

Bugfixes
--------

Minor enhancements
------------------

Since 0.4.0 (2006-05-22)
========================
Features
--------
* ability to create cross-referenced reports, indicating where methods are
  called from (--callsites)
* more refinements in the heuristics: now several kinds of multi-line quoted
  strings are handled properly
* --include-file to specify files not to be ignored in the report(s)
* implemented a task generator for Rant

Bugfixes
--------
* corrected the LOC counts in the XHTML summaries
* pure-Ruby tracing module works again; was broken in 0.4.0
* RcovTask#ruby_opts fixed; they were being passed to rcov instead of ruby
* solved the DOCTYPE issue (it'd get put at the end of the file under some
  Ruby versions)

Minor enhancements
------------------
* slightly more readable XHTML reports, esp. for IE
* text reports fit in 79 columns so they look OK with cmd.exe
* try to guide the user when all files were considered "uninteresting" by rcov
* the output_dir is preserved in RcovTasks when the user specifies --profile
  via the RCOVOPTS env. var.

Since 0.3.0 (2006-05-05)
========================

Features
--------
* easy automation via Rake using the bundled Rcov::RcovTask
* better heuristics: supports heredocs at last, including variants your editor
  is probably unable to handle, and =begin/=end comments
* --rails option to ignore files under vendor/, enviroment/ and config/
* parts of the runtime exposed and documented for external use
* new color scheme, with alternating shades of the base colors
* -w to set $VERBOSE=true (turns on warnings)
* --text-report and --text-summary
* --sort and --sort-reverse for the summaries and reports
* --threshold and --only-uncovered
* --replace-progname

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------
* renamed --text to --text-counts and --rich-text to --text-coverage: they
  were misnamed to begin with
* changed the meaning of -t and -T (--text-summary and --text-report)
* $0 is not changed by default for each loaded file anymore; the old 
  behavior (modulo a small bugfix) can be reproduced with --replace-progname

Since 0.2.0 (2006-02-25)
========================

Features
--------
* --exclude-only
* consolidate multiple references to the same underlying .rb file
  (much needed for Rails)
* --test-unit-only

Fixes
-----
* consider and/op operators
* honor --no-color in (rich) text mode 
* output valid XHTML indices

Since 0.1.0
===========
Tons. Better output, MUCH faster (two orders of magnitude), better command
line...
