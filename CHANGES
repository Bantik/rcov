Since 0.3.0 (2006-05-05)
========================

Features
--------
* better heuristics (supports heredocs at last, including variants your editor
  is probably unable to handle)
* new color scheme, with alternating shades of the base colors
* -w to set $VERBOSE=true (turns on warnings)
* --text-report and --text-summary

Since 0.2.0 (2006-02-25)
========================

Features
--------
* --exclude-only
* consolidate multiple references to the same underlying .rb file
  (much needed for Rails)
* --test-unit-only

Fixes
-----
* consider and/op operators
* honor --no-color in (rich) text mode 
* output valid XHTML indices

Since 0.1.0
===========
Tons. Better output, MUCH faster (two orders of magnitude), better command
line...
